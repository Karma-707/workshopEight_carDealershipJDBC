# üöóüõªüöô Vehicle Dealership Management System

Welcome to the **Vehicle Dealership Management System**! 
This project allows the user to manage a vehicle inventory for a dealership.
A console-based Java application that simulates a full vehicle dealership management system. 
It supports inventory operations, contract processing, receipt generation, error logging, and an interactive user interface.
This version uses a **MySQL database** and the **DAO (Data Access Object) pattern** for clean data management.

## üìú Error Logging 

Whenever an error occurs (such as invalid user input or unexpected system failures), the program logs the error details to a file called `exceptions.log`. This log includes:

- **Timestamp**: The date and time when the error occurred.
- **Error Message**: The exception message detailing what went wrong.

This log can help developers diagnose and troubleshoot issues with the program.

### Example of Logged Error:
Time of occurrence: 2025-05-11 14:30:12 Invalid input: -1 for mileage

# üî• Cool Code Highlight: Dynamic Contract Saving

The `saveContract()` method in ContractFileManager is a great example of clean and scalable code. 
It dynamically detects whether a contract is a sales or lease contract and writes the appropriate data to a shared file (`contracts.csv`).

This design uses polymorphism, Java‚Äôs instanceof pattern matching, and structured CSV formatting ‚Äî making it both powerful and easy to extend in the future.


````
if(contract instanceof SalesContract salesContract) {
    Vehicle chosenVehicle = salesContract.getVehicleChosen();

    //write to sales contract file
    try {
        BufferedWriter bufferedWriter = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter("contracts.csv", true));
        String isFinanced;
        if(salesContract.isFinanced()) {
            isFinanced = "YES";
        }
        else {
            isFinanced = "NO";
        }

        String firstLine = String.format("SALE|%s|%s|%s|%d|%d|%s|%s|%s|%s|%d|%.2f|%.2f|%.2f|%.2f|%.2f|%s|%.2f\n",
                salesContract.getDate(),
